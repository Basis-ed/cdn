# Why
- to share files between projects such as bootstrap, datatables, tagify, and other libraries

# How
- link as `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Basis-ed/cdn/bintegrator/logo.png`
- if you want to serve from a github branch, link as `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Basis-ed/cdn@develop/bintegrator/logo.png`
- feel free to add .min to automatically minify file for faster serving! i.e. bootstrap.min.js or bootstrap.min.css
- if you want to serve multiple files at the same time use `http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Basis-ed/cdn/tagify.min.css,gh/Basis-ed/cdn/tagify.min.js` comma separated pattern
